/*
 * Write a program that prints the sum of two random integers between 1 and 6
 * (such as you might get when rolling two dice).
 *
 * Note:
 *   Each random integer should be between 1 and 6, inclusive.
 *   The program should generate two separate random numbers, then print their sum.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Output: 9   (if the random numbers were 4 and 5)
 *
 *   Output: 3   (if the random numbers were 1 and 2)
