## 1. Programming Paradigms
Programming paradigms refer to styles or approaches used to write computer programs.  
The choice of paradigm depends on the nature and requirements of the problem.

### Types of Paradigms
1. **Declarative Programming**
2. **Imperative Programming**

---

## 1.1 Declarative Programming
- Focuses on **what** the program should accomplish.
- Does **not** emphasize how to achieve it.
- You describe the desired result, not the control flow.
- **Examples:** SQL, HTML

---

## 1.2 Imperative Programming
- Focuses on **how** the program should operate.
- Programmer provides explicit, step-by-step instructions.
- Uses explicit control flow (loops, conditionals, function calls).

---

# 2. Procedure-Oriented vs Object-Oriented Programming

All computer programs contain **code** and **data**.  
The difference between paradigms depends on how these are organized.

---

## 2.1 Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)
- Organization is around **procedures/functions**.
- Data stored in variables & data structures.
- Functions operate on external data.
- Potential issues:
  - Weak data security
  - Poor organization in large programs

---

## 2.2 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Organizes code and data around **objects**.
- Data is encapsulated within objects.
- Access only through methods.
- Objects combine:
  - **Attributes** (data)
  - **Methods** (functions)

---

# 3. Object-Oriented Programming Basics

## 3.1 Objects and Classes
- **Objects** are instances of **classes**.
- They encapsulate both **data** and **behaviors**.
- **Class**: a blueprint/template for creating objects.
- Each object has:
  - **State** (attributes)
  - **Behavior** (methods)
  - **Identity** (unique existence)

---

# 4. Goals of OOP
- **Code Reusability** (via inheritance)
- **Data Encapsulation**
- **Security** (controlled access through methods)
- **Abstraction** (show only essential details)

---

# 5. OOP Principles in Java

### The Four Pillars
1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Abstraction**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**

---

## 5.1 Encapsulation
- Bundling data and methods inside a class.
- Restricts outside access to data.
- Achieved using access modifiers (private, public, etc.).

---

## 5.2 Abstraction
- Shows only essential details.
- Hides complexity from the user.
- Helps reduce programming complexity.
- Often implemented using **inheritance** and **interfaces**.

---

## 5.3 Polymorphism
Meaning: **"many forms"**  
A common interface can have multiple implementations.

### Analogy
- "Smell" behavior:
  - Dog smells differently from a cat, but both share the same behavior name.

### Types of Polymorphism

#### 1. Static Polymorphism
- Occurs at **compile time**.
- Achieved through **method/function overloading**.

#### 2. Dynamic Polymorphism
- Occurs at **runtime**.
- Achieved through **method overriding**.

---

## 5.4 Inheritance
- A class acquires properties of another class.
- **Superclass** → the class being inherited from.
- **Subclass** → the class that inherits.
- Subclass becomes a *specialized* version.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces duplicate code
  - Promotes reusability

---

# 6. Java Compilation & Execution

### Java Compiler
- Compiles Java code to **Java bytecode**.

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Interprets/executes bytecode.
- Makes Java:
  - **Portable**
  - **Secure**

### Java Editions
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**
  > Java EE depends on Java SE.

- Object-Oriented  
- Portable  
- Platform Independent  
- Secured  
- Robust  
- Architecture Neutral  
- Interpreted  
- High Performance  
- Multithreaded  
- Distributed  
- Dynamic
